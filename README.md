# personal-log
This is a personal project of logging highlights from my life. At the moment, it only containes events from 2019 to present as I'm still currently compiling older photoes for older events. The main purpose of this project is to practice Astro as a framework and experiment with CMS using Sanity Studio. Hope you enjoy!
