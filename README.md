# personal-log

This is a personal project of logging highlights from my life. At the moment, it only contains events from 2019 to the present, as I'm still currently compiling older photos for older events. The primary purpose of this project is to practice Astro as a framework and experiment with CMS using Sanity Studio. I hope you enjoy!
